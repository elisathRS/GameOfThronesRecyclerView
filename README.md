# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Mary Ramirez**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Game of Thrones Characters RecyclerView** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of characters from the Game of Thrones API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü§ìüìö‚≠ê**

## Notes

Through this project, I've gained experience in integrating a RecyclerView to display a dynamic list of data that can be scrolled, and I've also learned how to retrieve and connect this data from API requests.
